# Data Distribution Visualization

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable. Specifically, it focuses on visualizing the distribution of ages/genders in a population.

The project was developed with the assistance of Prodigy Infotech and aims to provide an intuitive and insightful representation of data.

## Features

- **Bar Chart/Histogram**: Visualize the distribution of a chosen variable.
- **Customizable**: Easy to modify for different types of data.
- **Multiple Data Sources**: Supports visualizing distributions from various data sources or datasets, allowing for comparative analysis.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Pandas, Numpy
